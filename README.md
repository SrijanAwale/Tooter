# Tooter
This is kind of a ripoff of Twitter, "Tooter", which takes in 'Toots' from users and uploads them to a file.
It also authenticates for a user, and you can choose if you want to read toots from the file or if you want to add toots to the file. 
You can follow certain people and it will only show you the toots of the people you follow.
I have tried to do it as simply as possible, without using libraries.
